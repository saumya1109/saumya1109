# Hi there, I'm Saumya Gupta! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate software developer, and I'd love to share my projects with you.

The best way to learn is through practice. Coding is like cooking; it needs patience, a bit of love to make it better, and a whole lot of passion.
I'm constantly on a quest to learn something new and keep my brain from rusting. Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories – who knows, you might find something useful!

## 🔭 About Me

🌟 My Belief: If you want something you've never had, you must be willing to do something you've never done.🚀

- **🔭 Current Focus**: Always aiming to optimize my code and my life..
- **🌱 Learning Journey**: Deep diving into Python, one script at a time.
- **💬 Ask Me About**: Code, tech trends, or that one time I debugged for 6 hours straight.
- **⚡ Outside of Work**: When I'm not coding, I'm reverse-engineering my dance routines.
